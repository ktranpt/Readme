A result-driven and passionate professional with IT background and tracked records of excellent 
customer service delivery, I am looking to make a career transition to Data Analysis field. I have worked 
in both IT technical positions and customer facing roles with proven abilities to liaise with stakeholders 
and adapt to business requirements. I am eager to learn new skills and will make positive contributions 
to the growth of the company and take on new responsibilities and challenges when called upon.
